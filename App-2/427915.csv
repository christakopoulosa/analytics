It is frustrating that the Bank Statements still have to be posted but as we still have to post TM1 + Declaration this does not prove too difficult.

Before some decision maker insinuates failure to respond and swings the axe down how hard is it in this technical age to press a SEND button.

But i make no excuses of this. The notification did not arrive. I wrote to the TC explaining no receipt, even though if the Christmas holidays once removed gives a period of O Lic absence no more than a week. I have since heard nothing. Today i telephoned & was told the TC deems my reasoning not good enough, not exceptional enough, so i loose my licence & so no work for me and the boy. The dept in question has my email address, they confirm they have my email address & even though they have used it in the past when it suits them,,when it suits me does not apply.

The option to extend the items per page view (25 50 100)and the Back option need to be at the top and foot of the page as this all results in a lot of unnecessary clicking and scrolling to navigate around the page - very frustrating if the Operator suddenly registers more than 25 changes. Having taken the option to extend items per page, it should remember it until you actually log out, not have to keep resetting the choice each time you have used the back button to return to the list","Bus registrations","Fairly difficult ","See previous comments - site too clunky and slow to respond, multiple clicks/sctolls required to get back to what you want to do, making a brief task overly time consuming"

Your search facilities do not allow you to filter down the long lists that can appear - so if the company has a name that includes a common component - such as 'Transport' or 'Systems' very long lists are generated. There doesn't seem to be a way of making the search more limited. For example, if I search for 'Glass Systems' I get over 1300 results, whereas 'Glass' alone only gives around 400. If I could search for 'glass'+'system' I might get the 4 or 5 that I actually am looking for.
